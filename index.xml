      <description>Hi, I’m Adam.
I’m a software engineer who really loves blogs. I, however, really suck at writing. In university I once managed to get 19% on an essay, although I did just about get the grasp of academic writing, in the end, clutching a first on my dissertation module.
I’d love to be able to write well-articulated blog posts that can excite readers about topics I am passionate about, and the only way I am going to get better at that is by doing it.</description>
