      <description>Thanks to a combination of a little snow in the UK, a cancelled flight, and a lot of rain in Lisbon, I recently ended up spending a day stuck in a hotel room. So I did what any bored software engineer does, mess about and write some code.
A couple of days earlier at work, we updated our Github slack integration. Github has released an updated version for non-enterprise users that was much prettier and gave a lot of nice functionality from slack commands rather than having to go to an admin page.</description>

      <description>Hi, I’m Adam.
I’m a software engineer who really loves blogs. I, however, really suck at writing. In university I once managed to get 19% on an essay, although I did just about get the grasp of academic writing, in the end, clutching a first on my dissertation module.
I’d love to be able to write well-articulated blog posts that can excite readers about topics I am passionate about, and the only way I am going to get better at that is by doing it.</description>
